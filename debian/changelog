ros-melodic-realtime-tools (1.8.3-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Fix linking
    The library needs to be linked against roscpp and Boost thread.
    GCC won't complain about missing symbols for a shared library,
    but other linkers (like clang's) will not accept it by default.
  * Added Travis support
  * Renamed manifest.xml so it doesn't brek rosdep
